**Who are we?**

We are a group of postgraduate students in the School of Biological Sciences at UQ. This blog has been created to help develop scientific communication amongst the wider community by providing a platform for the sharing of ideas, knowledge and research.

We welcome posts by any individual within the postgraduate community that are biological sciences related.

You can contact us through the channels linked in the about page.
